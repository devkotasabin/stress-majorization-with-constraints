# stress-majorization-with-constraints

This repository contains a python implementation of stress majorization for graph layout. This also contains the code for  stress majorization with user specified constraints.

The file "stress_maj.py" implements [Graph Drawing by Stress Majorization](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Documentation/GKN04.pdf).

The file "stress_maj_revisited.py" implements an alternative version of [Revisiting Stress Majorization as a Unified Framework for Interactive Constrained Graph Visualization](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017634/) using the formulation of [Graph Drawing by Stress Majorization](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Documentation/GKN04.pdf).
